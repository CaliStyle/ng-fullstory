/**
 * Policies Configuration
 * (app.config.footprints)
 *
 * Define which prerequisites a request must pass before reaching the intended
 * controller action. By default, no policies are configured for controllers or
 * footprints, therefore the request always will directly reach the intended
 * handler.
